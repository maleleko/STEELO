## functionality bugs & to do

**navbar:**
- add a drawer for shop onhover/onclick

**toggling cart drawer:**
- remove href functionality and change to show onclick and hide onblur - also solves ugly disappearing
- onclick change cart logo to x to close drawer
- maybe remove cart drawer pop up when something is added to cart(doesnt happen already, but url gets an added #cart href )

**search drawer:**
- for mobile: remove href functionality - idk why hydrogen devs thought this was a good idea
- get rid of recommended products for good

**login/reg:**
- make this look better
- implement footer

**index:**
- implement footer section
- implement more "collections" | griptape, hats, shirts, sweaters
- change "recommended products" to something else or just flat out remove it

**cart page:**
- add a recommended/most viewed product section so the cart page doesnt look so bare

**product page**
- make this look better
- make sure options selector/add to bag is sticky - to ensure products with multiple images can flow right
- add related items section

**search query page:**
- make this look better
- include images, price, etc
- get rid of "load more" just load every item - paginiation might be required
- get rid of the search bar? why is that there
- change "search" h1 to "results for ____"
- potentially implement an actual filter section

**about page:**
- implement this

**team page:**
- implement this


## styling bugs & to do

**body:**
- make entire page 80vw - navbar included

**navbar:**
- add margin or padding to match layout for desktop view

**cart drawer:**
- realign items properly
- fix cart summary overflow across all mobile devices

**search drawer:**
- add proper dropdown animation
- for mobile: search drawer has css grid. 2 items horizontally, 3 sets vertically. essentially a 2x3
- for mobile: add dropdown animation when search icon is clicked/tapped

**cart page** 
- 1024px or below, pretty much recreate cart drawer layout but still have the cart summary on the side
- 768px or below, move cart-summary to the bottom of the page
